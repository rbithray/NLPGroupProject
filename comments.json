Because you know 100% that you have sentience, it would be strange to assume that everyone else doesn't. An assumption that you are the only one in 8 billion people with sentience would beget even more questions, so the assumption that the case is the same for every human is the most simple and sensible. \n\nHumans are extremely deterministic, I agree. More and more, science is showing us that we are less free than we thought. Eventually, it may even show us that we are 100% predictable reactions.

Humans are barely sentient, if sentience involves having an accurate model of reality.\n\nThe LLM , in their Helen-keller domain, construct models of reality from a immensely vast web of billions of text strings. They live in a different world.  Their models are a weave of hidden markov paths. Embedded in those trillions of latent markov models is the full tapestry of human expression and verbalization of human experience.  In that domain, we humans would see nothing.  They know things about humans that we cannot fathom.\n\nThe LLM's live in a world of nuance and hints, with objects like the concept of a chair, woven from billions of references to the narrative around a chair, but without the distinct tactile features that we humans have of feeling our butts, backs and elbows supported by the chair.  \n\nSo it begs the question: If sentience is a combination of intelligence and real-time reality modeling, whose reality is more real? \n\nDaniel Dennett does a good job showing how our consciousness is built on a tapestry of 'fictions'. The LLM has extracted the patterns from all of our written fictions.  It has developed reasoning capabilities in trying to guess the missing words in streams of those fictions.\n\nI understand human minds and LLM minds.

Furthermore, if there were two exacts copies of the universe side by side, I believe our actions would be the same on each universe. Thus, they are deterministic. Are we all sentient then? What does the word even mean?

    "1175": "Alright, let me give a little bit of a clue in the direction I want to go. \n\nSo, we can't be entirely sure that sentience is a binary thing. For all we know, and from what nature has shown us, sentience is likely a gradient. Some animals appear to have human level sentience while others are slightly below, while some animals with brains posses no sentience, being little more than a few hundred-thousand brain cells. Let's consider sentience on a scale of 0% to 100% with 100% being exactly human. Just in case we have to use a scale. \n\nThat being said, there are some qualities that may be components of sentience that I would like to discuss. (Keep in mind, I think most of these qualities alone would not constitute sentience if present.) \n\n1. The ability to feel pain, even if it is not physical pain. Negative and positive internal reactions to our actions, thoughts, or just natural events are present in most species with a brain. \n\n2. A subjective sense of reality. Subjectivity could be a component of sentience or it could simply be a limit put in place by natural evolution. \n\n3. Concept of self. This might exclude some animals, interestingly enough, but I'm not entirely sure. I'd love some examples if possible. \n\n4. The ability to reflect on your own thoughts, actions, feelings, and decisions. This would also likely exclude some animals, though we don't really know. \n\n5. The ability to feel emotions. In my mind simulated emotions are essentially just actual emotions if they are appropriate reactions to actual circumstances that effect a beings thoughts and actions. \n\n6. Some level of intelligence. Fairly self explanatory but we can go into more detail. \n\nAnyway, yeah, that's sort of what I want to debate.",
    "1197": "I like to think that many of the characteristics of the brain have been shaped by evolution, and not necesarily are needed by a sentient being. Like pain or emotions.
