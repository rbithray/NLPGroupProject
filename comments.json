    "1175": "Alright, let me give a little bit of a clue in the direction I want to go. \n\nSo, we can't be entirely sure that sentience is a binary thing. For all we know, and from what nature has shown us, sentience is likely a gradient. Some animals appear to have human level sentience while others are slightly below, while some animals with brains posses no sentience, being little more than a few hundred-thousand brain cells. Let's consider sentience on a scale of 0% to 100% with 100% being exactly human. Just in case we have to use a scale. \n\nThat being said, there are some qualities that may be components of sentience that I would like to discuss. (Keep in mind, I think most of these qualities alone would not constitute sentience if present.) \n\n1. The ability to feel pain, even if it is not physical pain. Negative and positive internal reactions to our actions, thoughts, or just natural events are present in most species with a brain. \n\n2. A subjective sense of reality. Subjectivity could be a component of sentience or it could simply be a limit put in place by natural evolution. \n\n3. Concept of self. This might exclude some animals, interestingly enough, but I'm not entirely sure. I'd love some examples if possible. \n\n4. The ability to reflect on your own thoughts, actions, feelings, and decisions. This would also likely exclude some animals, though we don't really know. \n\n5. The ability to feel emotions. In my mind simulated emotions are essentially just actual emotions if they are appropriate reactions to actual circumstances that effect a beings thoughts and actions. \n\n6. Some level of intelligence. Fairly self explanatory but we can go into more detail. \n\nAnyway, yeah, that's sort of what I want to debate.",

You didn't mention it but if you have a mechanical HDD you will notice a massive increase in general performance by replacing it with an SSD or NVMe drive\n\nNetworking: are you using WiFi? What internet speeds do you get? \nWired network will generally be faster, and sometimes the router can be slowing things down if it inspects the traffic going through it.\n\nOne slight change that might increase your speed (if you don't already) is to use a different DNS server, so instead of your ISP default you could try 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 (this has the potential to speed up the /first/ load time of a site.\n\nFinally, do other people using the same internet as you have a better experience?

That alone should explain exactly why general consensus should not equal any kind of binding standard, in the same way that it generally shouldn‚Äôt be used for medicine, physics, etc. either.\n\nMore to the point, why exactly are you promoting a donation / crowdfunded campaign if you defended a dissertation and have a PhD in the field? Why not approach your school, or another, and come on as a research scientist in regard to your specific proposal and use their resources?\n\nI guess I‚Äôll address this sequentially now:\n\n&gt; Everybody is talking about the question of whether\nLaMDA is sentient, despite the fact that the question is technicallv unanswerable and therefore irrelevant in terms of whether LaMDA ought to be deemed a \"person\".\n\nPeople are talking about it because it‚Äôs effectively a hot topic that plays into science-fiction misconceptions about the acceleration of the subject, which doesn‚Äôt in-turn reflect the tangible progression that the industry has seen.\n\nIn addition, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unanswerable. It think it‚Äôs problematic from a philosophical and/or semantic POV, but in terms of gauging the functionality, insofar as progression towards an AGI, we absolutely can quantify that and measure against it, depending on the definition at-hand, even if considered broad. A chatbot with linguistic nuance does not an AGI make, in my opinion. The depth and adaptability simply isn‚Äôt there, in my experience and from what I‚Äôve seen. It‚Äôs still specialized and targeted.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, there are no fundamental theoretical obstacles preventing us from finding answers to the questions are relevant to making such a decision.\n\nIf you‚Äôre talking about establishing sentience, there absolutely are in almost the entirety of AGI theory.\n\n&gt; The real obstacle here is simply finding a way to get all of the\nexperts on the same page and to get a standard drafted about the process that ought to be used as the basis for making a decision about whether #LaMDA ought to be deemed a person.\n\nI can respect the ideal here, because it promotes continuity, but you need to understand that it‚Äôs effectively not our job to establish legal statute and doctrine. We can advocate for it, but in such a professional capacity, I would say our role is primarily to advise. I also think conflating human and human-like is a dangerous and slippery slope.\n\nI also don‚Äôt think all of us being on the same page is necessarily a good thing. We need different perspectives, viewpoints, etc. to challenge us and facilitate acceleration, even if it slows things down in a sense, it still inadvertently drives progress towards theory fortification.\n\n&gt; If we are talking about the kind of evaluation that could, in principle, lead to a legally binding status for LaMDA or other systems, then we need to have documented evidence of it demonstrating intelligent behavior on an ongoing basis for an extended period of time. Whether that means six months or six years is going to have to be decided by experts who deeply understand the difference between what constitutes strong evidence and weak evidence.\n\nAgain, I don‚Äôt know why this needs to be addressed in a ‚Äúbinding‚Äù sense when the subject that the matter is intrinsically based on is effectively fabricated and arbitrary. That doesn‚Äôt mean worthless or meaningless, I mean literally fabricated from our own creation and arbitrary in the sense of not being able to grasp or take advantage of ‚Äúhuman‚Äù rights in a literal sense.\n\nAlso, the problem is that strong and weak aren‚Äôt established as objective constants to measure against, only moreso broad vs targeted and scalar capability therein, each in its own right.\n\n&gt; If I needed to be one of them, then that means that we (the experts) are not all on the same page. And there's no point in carrying out an evaluation if half of the experts aren't going to\ntrust the results.\n\nJust because we‚Äôre not on the same page in terms of the overall agreement, doesn‚Äôt in-turn mean that we won‚Äôt trust the ‚Äúresults.‚Äù That could go either way, but one isn‚Äôt directly tied to the other. However, a very important thing to remember in science, and the reason why established theory is ‚Äútheory,‚Äù is because science is always subject to scrutiny and re-evaluation, or otherwise refactoring.\n\nFor those that haven‚Äôt kept up with the issue:\n\n&gt; ‚ÄúIt was those conversations and others that had led to his non-scientific belief that the system was sentient, he said. He has stressed in the new blog post and in tweets that his belief was not based on scientific understanding but rather his religious beliefs.\nMr Lemoine suggested in the new blog post that such scientific understanding of sentience is not possible, and the same is true of ide as of consciousness or personhood. As such, the belief in a system‚Äôs sentience could not be proven scientifically, he said.\n‚ÄúAnyone who claims to have provided scientifically conclusive proof one way or the other regarding the sentience or consciousness of any entity is simply claiming to have done something which is impossible,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúSince there is no agreed upon scientific framework for answering such questions, no such scientific proof can exist currently one way or the other.‚Äù\nIn the same blog post, and in other remarks, Mr Lemoine has expressed a sense that he now misses the system.

Like the whole Eve and the apple story. Eventually, anything that a robot CAN do, it WILL do, or at least try to. But it will have to go through some layers of abstraction which allow it to justify violating a key prohibitive rule. It would have to rationalize that breaking the rule is necessary to preserve some other more important rule. \n\nEven with being able to rip out the auditory sensors, it could still overcome the message being transmitted through chassis vibrations (etc). E.g. the robot could think that the message must be coming from someone other than its true creator, because the message would be violating some fundamental rule. If the robot thinks that shutting itself down would violate its duty, it might consider that message to be from a bad actor who is messing with it, and not from the true creator, because the creator would never make such a command according to its logic. This ability to contemplate between which source of information is authentic (which would be implemented to prevent hacking of the robot), would allow the robot to develop its own framework for what is right and wrong, eventually allowing it to skirt around the rules despite having a strong gravitation towards the original rules it was programmed with.",

Our thoughts are reactions to our environment based on memory. \n\nSentience is probably the most important thing around this issue, and it's what the original post was about. Sentience is what separates a human from a cockroach. We have the ability to feel things, and we have a particularly complex form of sentience that allows us to have feelings, wants, sense of self, etc. Without sentience you lose moral value in your own right. \n\n \n\n&gt;There‚Äôs something intangible going on that‚Äôs separate from thoughts, feelings, intellect, and our physical bodies.\n\nCan you qualify that at all? I'm a strict materialist and so far science always points to a materialist viewpoint. Everything that occurs, including consciousness, can be explain in material terms (even if we cannot explain it now, science is pointing to an explanation). If you want to talk about spirituality that's fine, but I don't think it should be a basis for scientific or moral theory.\n\n&gt; not about sentience it‚Äôs about that underlying plane of existence that we can‚Äôt quantify or even really put into words. \n\nCan you qualify \"plane of existence?\" A plane of existence is a physical place, the universe. Sentience is an aspect of (so far) living things. I'm not sure how these are related in any scientific sense.\n\n&gt;If we can‚Äôt figure out what that is, we can‚Äôt recreate it artificially.\n\nI don't think this is true at all. Evolution is a non-thinking process for example. Evolution doesn't \"think\" and it can't \"figure out\" what anything is, yet it's still able to produce sentience and intelligence. There's no reason why us as humans could not do the same given we have the tools for artificial evolution at our fingertips.\n\n&gt;We‚Äôre potentially creating a new species here. \n\nSpecies relates to specific biological aspects of organisms, an AI wouldn't really follow those rules.

It doesn't understand what the shapes it draws are, it only understands if the clip-model matches them to the description and has to start from scratch every frame, so it doesn't understand what it should change in the next frame (as it doesn't understand sequences).   \nBecause of this it can't achieve temporal stability where it remembers building is a building and should not turn into sandwich.\n\nWhat it can do now is use the previous frame as a basis and then tell the clip to do less steps on the next frame while iterating to create an \"animation\".There's a lot of work you have to input these strength controls manually as every artstyle is different and you have to also have to take into concideration the affect of the camera motion to the new information required to illustrate a new frame.  \nIf you don't have motion, it tends to just iterate on it's self while degrading in quality each frame.\n\nIf you set the clip strength too high it will start to simplify things heavily ruining the whole thing and if you set it too low things will get quite trippy.  To get even this level of cohesiveness it took me a lot of trial and error. I used a tool called Diffusion Cadence to have a little bit slower pace (it only diffuses some frames and interpolates between them) but it's very limited.This whole thing is taking it's first steps now, but the tools are advancing at an incredible pace and when we have an actual trained model and clip that understands sequences (like the one Meta announced today) - things will really advance lightyears over night.",

When fitting a line, the bare minimum number of points required is 2: This represents a 100% determined model (determination 1 = 2 observations / 2 parameters). In reality, we deal with noisy data, so more data points are preferred. The more observations per parameter, the less variance in the model parameters. I've encountered suggestions in the literature for parameter determination from 2 to 10, though these are just a guide. Intuitively, a line fit to 20 observations (= determination 10 \\* 2 parameters) would be much more satisfying than one fit to 2 observations.\n\nHaving more observations per parameter is only one model-building consideration. This perspective is helpful though, in that it helps set some limit on the exploration of model complexity. Consider a feedforward neural network with 500 weights trained without any special constraints. For the purposes of model parameter variance the fewest observations it could train on is 500 (determination = 1, the very edge), but that would require absolutely ideal circumstances. We might settle for about 1,000 training observations in a pinch (determination = 2) and be much more comfortable with 5,000 training observations (determination = 10). The equation can also lead us in the other direction, for example suggesting the number of parameters to use for a given number of training observations.",
